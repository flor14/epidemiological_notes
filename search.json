If we want to unify results for the same age for cohorts that start at different ages, we will find that the trend is much flatter than the effects of the cohorts in isolation.\n\nOne way to avoid the bias is to use an approach called multiple longitudinal design Basically, multiple longitudinal design is to work with more than one cohort at the same time. If all the cohorts show a defined pattern for a particular measure in time, we will be able to detect it with this approach.\n\nTest or learning effect.

If the assumptions are met, ANOVA is more powerful for smaller samples:\n\n“The restriction of the assumption of sphericity (i.e. equal correlations and equal variances over time) leads to an increase in degrees of freedom, i.e. an increase in power for the “univariate” approach. This increase in power becomes more important when the sample size becomes smaller. Historically, the “multivariate” approach was developed later than the “univariate” approach, especially for situations when the assumption of sphericity does not hold. So, one could argue that when the assumption of sphericity is violated, the “multivariate” approach should be used.\n\n– Extracted from Twisk (2013)\nMAMOVA in R - https://www.appsilon.com/post/manova-in-r"
