This can produce a bias in the age trend.\ncohort effect. If we want to unify results for the same age for cohorts that start at different ages, we will find that the trend is much flatter than the effects of the cohorts in isolation.\n\nOne way to avoid the bias is to use an approach called multiple longitudinal design Basically, multiple longitudinal design is to work with more than one cohort at the same time. If all the cohorts show a defined pattern for a particular measure in time, we will be able to detect it with this approach.\n\nTest or learning effect.
