If the assumptions are met, ANOVA is more powerful for smaller samples:\n\n“The restriction of the assumption of sphericity (i.e. equal correlations and equal variances over time) leads to an increase in degrees of freedom, i.e. an increase in power for the “univariate” approach. This increase in power becomes more important when the sample size becomes smaller. Historically, the “multivariate” approach was developed later than the “univariate” approach, especially for situations when the assumption of sphericity does not hold. So, one could argue that when the assumption of sphericity is violated, the “multivariate” approach should be used.\n\n– Extracted from Twisk (2013)\nMAMOVA in R - https://www.appsilon.com/post/manova-in-r"

(but, you are not using all the data)\nUse individual regression lines with time.\n\n\n\n1.5.2 New methods.\nWith the development of (new) statistical techniques, such as:\n\nGeneralized estimating equations (GEE) analysis and;\nMixed-model analysis,\n\nit has become possible to analyze longitudinal relationships using all available longitudinal data, without summarizing the longitudinal development of each subject into one value.\nCrippa (2022) A review of Longitudinal Data Analysis in R: https://rpubs.com/alecri/review_longitudinal\n\nIn this model the coefficients of interest are β1j, because these regression coefficients show the magnitude of the longitudinal relationship between the outcome variable (Yit) and the covariates (Xijt).\nBecause of the dependency of the repeated observations within one subject, the relationship between X and Y must be adjusted for the subject. There is one by subject and are represented by dummy variables.\n\n\n1.5.2.1 GEE\n\nBefore carrying out a GEE analysis, the within-subject correlation structure must be chosen.\nIn the literature it is assumed that GEE analysis is robust against a wrong choice of the correlation structure. However, this is only the case when there are no missing data and when the model correctly specifies the mean.\nThe interpretation of β1 is more complex than in a cross-sectional analysis.\n\n\n\n1.5.2.2 Mixed Models\n\nThis type of study design is characterized by a hierarchical structure. In longitudinal studies observations within one subject over time are correlated. The observations over time are nested within the subject.\nThe way mixed model analysis adjusts for the subject is different from the way GEE analysis adjusts for the subject.\nwhen an adjustment is made for the subject (i.e. the id_number), for each subject different intercepts are calculated.\nThe first step within a mixed model analysis is therefore to draw a normal distribution around the intercepts and in the second step the variance of that normal distribution is estimated.\nThat variance is added to the longitudinal regression model in order to adjust for the subject in an efficient way.\nBecause this variance is known as the random intercept (β0i), mixed model analysis is also known as random coefficient analysis.\nThe general idea behind a mixed model analysis is that the unexplained variance in outcome variable Y is divided into different components. One of the components is related to the random intercept and another component is related to random slopes.\n\nA model with a random intercept allows the intercepts to differ between the subjects, but the regression coefficient for the covariate X is the same for all the subjects. In a longitudinal study it is not uncommon that besides the intercepts also the regression coefficients for X differ between the subjects\nWhen regression coefficients for X differ between subjects, there is an interaction between the covariate X and the subject. As for the adjustment for the subject, also the interaction with the subject has to be added to a cross-sectional regression model with dummy variables."
